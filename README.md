#### Requirements: <br />
  * Windows(tested on Windows10x64)
  * Python 3
  * Numpy
  * Cv2
  
#### Code execution: <br /> 
The following will run through the code execution in steps of inputs to enter and expected output

Execute python LSBM-algorithm.py in command prompt<br/>
1.In main function user is required to enter:<br />
    input image to "input_image" field<br />
    output image to "output_image" field<br />
    secret message to "secret_data" field<br />
2.The main function will embeed the secret message using LSBM algorithm and will decode the message<br />
3.During program running "Threshold binary inverse image (in gray)", "Image edges detection using canny algorithm"
will be printed to the screen<br />
4.At the end of the program image in the entered name of "output_image" will be created automatically in the src path<br />
